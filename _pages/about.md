I am a first-year **Ph.D. student** in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at **Vanderbilt University**, advised by **Prof. You Chen**. I am currently a researcher at the **OHPEN Lab** within **Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC)**.

My research goal is to **bridge the gap between engineering and clinical care**. I specialize in applying **Multimodal Representation Learning**, **Graph Neural Networks**, and **LLMs** to solve critical healthcare challenges, particularly in **Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD)**.

Prior to Vanderbilt, I received my M.S. and B.S. degrees from **UESTC** (University of Electronic Science and Technology of China).
